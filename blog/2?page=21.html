        <p>So things are settling down in Hong Kong. We are as boring as ever. When given a night to do something on our own, we choose to surf the internet and put together computers. Heaven help us. However, it is good to note that my constant access to internet at my friend Ellen's house (whom we are staying with) has made it possible for several posts to be written. And also because we are boring I can further update you to the lives of the Doube Dees: </p>
<p>We put a deposit down on a house. It is in an area called Shek Kok Mai and is really a stunning house. The apartment is huge in Hong Kong terms. We have about 700 sf of apartment and then sole access to the rooftop which is another 700 sf. We have 2 bedrooms (meaning one guest bedroom, *hint hint*), 2 bathrooms (one is our en suite! The other my darkroom?), the kitchen is pretty western; meaning there are cupboards, drawers and room to actually prepare food. Our bedroom opens out onto a balcony. The flooring is wood. I will post photos when we move in. But I am so happy with this apartment.</p>
<p>Searching for it was very typical Dave and Debbi style. We looked at 5 and then I convinced Dave to go for the most expensive apartment. We put the deposit down the very same day. The last time we needed to find an apartment it took us a day as well. We don't mess around. Its like look, look, look, like, ok lets get this one. To tell you the truth Dave didn't need to be too convinced. He really liked the place and after he did his obligatory number crunching decided that we could afford it.</p>

        <p>I pondered my choice of hairstyle yesterday as I crossed the GZ/HK border. In my passport photo I have bleach blonde hair that looks perfect because I had just been at the salon...so perfect that I think customs officials are having a difficult time determining if I am the person in the picture...now that I have practically no hair. One official asked me what my name was. Another asked me why I would do someting like that. (He was the Indian customs officer...they like their women to have long hair). And if I were to look closely at my picture, it does look like I could be wearing a wig. Or I could be using someone elses passport. Its crazy. I think to get into difficult or troubled countries I will need to go blonde again so I don't have to follow the &quot;red&quot; line on the floor. Or perhaps I need to get a blonde wig.</p>
<p>Its like the time my grandmother asked &quot;whose grad photo is that?&quot;  My mom said &quot;Debbi's.&quot;</p>
<p>I should become a spy if all it takes is a hair cut to make me look like a completely different person. Maybe a sniper too. I have really good vision. I see a new career for myself.</p>

        <p>Christmas is just around the corner. I am hoping we have our own house by then. But the best part about Christmas time is that it is the time of year when The Nutcracker is on! And because we are in Hong Kong we can actually afford to go. For the last few years I have harrassed Dave into getting tickets. But we were always too poor. Now its cheap! We have great seats for like CAN$50 each. I&quot;m so excited. I love the ballet. We have tickets for the 23rd. Whoohoo</p>
<p>And another thing to be exited about is that we are in Guangzhou, my old stomping grounds. Dave is getting dragged all over to my old haunts including: the &quot;Northern&quot; resturant, the cement park, Vanguards: the mega superstore, and tonight we'll meet up with some of my old friends and go shopping! hurray!</p>
<p>I know this is a wee bit random of a post. but i'm just so excited about getting to eat all the delicious things in GZ that I can't focus. Lam mien, here I come!</p>

        <p>Well Kids. The judges have come back into the room with the results. We have come to a decision. Dave and Debbi are moving to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>We have been impressed with Hong Kong from the moment we stepped off the airplane. Transit is amazing. People smile and laugh here. The expat population is huge. We can get organic food. The potential job for me (Debbi) is very good. We already have friends here. It is clean. It has English speaking universities so I can do some courses if I want. We are going to the Nutcracker this Christmas....and we can afford it! There is a huge arts community. I mean I could go on and on about how much we love Hong Kong but you'll have to come and see it yourselves. Many of you did mention that you were interested in visiting Hong Kong. (We're trying to get a apartment with a second room)</p>
<p>So the main reason that we chose Hong Kong was because we couldn't think of a reason not to. Our 3 complaints against Hong Kong thus far are: 1. They speak Cantonese so I can't use my Mandarin skills. 2. There is pollution...like everywhere in Asia. 3. It is expensive to live here. (If I get the job I'm hoping for there is a housing allowance and Dave and I are planning on living on the outskirts around a village called Sai Kung. It is a really stunning area to live in. Its right on the water and there is lots of hiking to be had. And its cheap) </p>
<p>So why not. It isn't behind the Chinese firewall and it really is not like the China I remember. </p>
<p>So here we stay. </p>

        <p>Several things have happened in a rather short span of time. </p>
<p>The first being that Dave and I ended up staying in Goa for 15 amazing days. It was great because we got to meet up with Byron again and we ended up with a wonderful group of people. We became like a group from summer camp and were really reluctant to move on. It was so sad when we all left (on the same day).  But our extended stay in Goa meant we needed to do some fast travelling to get to our the last few items on our to do in India list. So we went off to  Bangalore, en route to Pondicherry. We convinced a postal worker to extend his hours so we could send Christmas presents home and hopped on a very deluxe bus to Pondicherry. We would have one night in Pondy, one night in some random town while we waited for the train to Ooty. Hopped on a train to Ooty and have one day there and then hop on a bus back to Bangalore. We would have had one day in Bangalore and then flown to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The second thing that happened was that on the day we were supposed to go to Ooty, I got quite ill and had to lay in bed for more than a day.  So currently Dave and I are stuck in Pondicherry. The benefits of this are that we aren't travelling everyday for an entire week. But I miss out on the toy tain you take up to Ooty. Oh well. I guess if we can miss the Taj Mahal, we can miss the toy train. We'll save those for next time.</p>
<p>The third thing was that there are many new visa restrictions in South Korea for ESL teachers that will be coming up and we aren't sure where we will be in a couple weeks time. Any suggestions? </p>

        <p>Our life on the beach:</p>
<p>We wake up. We read in bed. We get dressed. We brush our teeth. We put on our shoes. We walk to breakfast. We order almost the same thing everyday at the same resturant. We read during breakfast. As we have been alone for a long time, we don't have much to say to each other. We finish breakfast and go to internet. Then we usually complete our one task for the day. Tasks have included: rent scooters, lay on the beach, buy a skirt, book tickets out of here, wash clothes. We usually only do one task per day. Then we read. I am averaging 1.5 books a day. Its a good thing the book store buys the books back, otherwise Dave's pack would be so heavy! ha ha. Then we go to dinner. Sometimes we get the girls in the shack to join us. And then we go to bed. Usually we fall asleep while reading.</p>
<p>That is a day in Dave and Debbi's life right now. Isn't it grand.</p>

        <p>These past few nights have been bizarre. I'm not sure if it is the build up of methoqine (the crazy anti-malarial medication we are taking) in my system, or that I have been having a drink or two with dinner, or what it is but the past 3 nights my dreams have been very vivid and very strange.</p>
<p>Take Tuesday night's dream. I dreamed about my friend Shane, whom I really haven't thought of for a few years. But In this dream I was upset that I hadn't invited him over for dinner when he was poor. Very strange.</p>
<p>Wednesday's dream was mostly me telling Dave about the &quot;rainbow fishy things&quot;. You know the rainbow fishy things. Yeah. And as this was me talking in my sleep, you can imagine how confused Dave was. I think he became more confused when I tried to explain how you use the rainbow fishy things. I also started being very concerned about a possible tsunami and how our little beach hut was going to float away. </p>
<p>Last night was not very much fun as I dreamed that someone I used to love thought I was vulgar and awful. I shouldn't really care what this person thinks of me but I wonder if subconsciously I still must. I woke up and felt terrible about myself. But after I woke Dave up so that he would cuddle. I felt so much better. </p>
<p>Tonight should bring some interesting dreams. I hope it is more along the lines that I make up story lines for people I don't even know anymore. </p>
