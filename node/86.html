        <p>When I first went to the hospital after falling down the stairs; I saw a doctor in 5 minutes. I went to radiology and was x-rayed in 10. I had to go back to the waiting area where I waited another 10 minutes to see the doctor again with my x-rays. I was given a week long sick leave and appointments to see a specialist and a physiotherapist in the coming week. Then I was helped by the nurse who threw an elastic sock thing on my ankle, taught me how to use the horrific, but free until my next appointment, walker and gave me drugs. This cost HK$100.</p>
<p>The next day I had to go into the hospital to exchange my walker for a set of crutches, thank heaven. I sat down with the physiotherapist who answered all of my questions and was really kind. We are renting the crutches for a total of HK$50/week. I then went downstairs and got the rest of my drugs. They were free because I had paid the initial HK$100 the day before. </p>
<p>Today I had my appointment with the Orthopaedic specialist. I initially had to wait 20 minutes to get into see him but after that it was amazing. He really, honestly looked at my ankle, unlike the cursory glaze any Canadian doctor has ever given me. He was concerned that I might have still broke something due to some weird bruising/pain so I was sent back down to radiology. My x-ray was done in 10 minutes. I waited a whole of one minute to see the specialist. He then spent 10 MINUTES! looking at and comparing my x-rays trying to decide if it was a shadow or a break. He decided that it was a break and then spent another 10 minutes answering my questions, setting up other appointments and giving me another sick leave for 2 MORE WEEKS (total sick leave given is 3 weeks so far).  His appointment cost HK$100.</p>
<p>I was then sent down to prosthetics and had a splint made for me. It was the coolest thing ever. I'd say even better than a cast, expect that no one can write on it. She took some measurements and went and cut this piece of plastic. She put it in hot water and then put it around my foot. As the plastic cooled it became my very own splint; made in the image of my beautiful ankle. The sucky part is that it keeps my ankle at a 90 degree angle and aches so bad. She then set up a check up appointment with me. My custom made splint cost me HK$100.</p>
<p>Finally, I went to the drug store and got stronger drugs for HK$20. It took 5 minutes. </p>
<p>So far the total amount spent on my poor, busted ankle is HK $420 or $54 Canadian. I really like the Hong Kong style of Health Care. The one thing to note is that I have a Hong Kong ID card. With this ID card I benefit from the public health care system. Dave doesn't have his ID card yet, so it is tough luck for him if he busts something (but we do have travel insurance as well to cover him).</p>
<p>There are some negative things like there is in every system. You have to go to several different floors and parts of the hospital in the course of a visit. One stop for the drugs, one to pay, one to wait, the actual appointment. It gets a bit old when you are on crutches and have gone up and down the floors once or twice. </p>
<p>Another annoyance is that they never really know which part of my name is my surname or my first name. They have no idea what to call me. Today they asked for Miss Leena. I was the only non-chinese person in the waiting room so I assumed it was for me. I guess they were trying to use my middle name Lynn? I believe that they get really self consious about using English in the microphone because they say everyone else's names clearly but they muffle and move away from the microphone when they go to call my name. </p>
<p>They don't drug you up. I am yet to see any drug that has more that 100 mg in it. They gave me an acetaminophen painkiler that is one eighth the strength of the Tylenol I normally take. He gave me stronger drugs today but they ain't no Percocet. Oh well. They did offer to give me an ingection for the pain when I showed up in emergency that first day. Should have taken them up on the offer if I wanted something stronger than baby-baby tylenol.  </p>
<p>But really do I have much to complain about? I have never had such good care. Ever. </p>
