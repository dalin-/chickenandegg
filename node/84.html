        <p>We had a lovely morning today. We went to church, met some new people, drank some tea and decided to head home. We discussed what we should do for lunch and talked about the weather. Truth be told, I don't really like lovely days. I like dramatic days where there is adventure and excitement. Give me drama or let me get back to bed! </p>
<p>So instead of continuing my participation in what was becoming a pleasant afternoon I threw myself down the 3 steps of a mini-bus and got my right foot lodged at an impossible angle. I stood half way out of the mini-bus, impeding other people who were attempting to alight. Concerned that I was in the way, I threw myself forward into my loving husband's arms while screaming bloody murder. A golf ball immediately started to grow out of my ankle. I cried and cried buckets of tears that floated the mini-bus off to it's next stop all while drawing the curious attention of everyone within 50 feet of me. </p>
<p>One lady stopped and did some ankle poking. Another woman stopped, who we know from church, and decided that we should visit the hospital. She offered to call 999 (the 911 of Hong Kong) but although I love making a scene, I don't like paying for making a scene. Instead we found a taxi who was given directions to the nearest hospital. The golf ball began to look like a baseball by this point and I made it clear to the cab driver that every bump he careened over would cause me to make whimpering sounds.</p>
<p>Eventually we made it to the hospital. We were told that we would have to wait a long time as these were public hospitals. We saw a doctor in 5 minutes and were off to radiology in 10. I unfortunately did not break my ankle. Instead I came away with a serious sprain. It is disappointing that I don't have a broken ankle for two reasons. One being that casts are really cool and all of your friends can sign them. The other reason is that people often think that sprains are a bit wimpy. Go on, I know you know someone who has walked on their sprained ankle after one minute of pain. The problem with serious sprains is that they are serious. In fact, I will get to enjoy some wonderful physiotherapy to help make my ankle better. A basic break of a bone is a pain in the butt, however, there are fewer long term concerns with your ankle. Sure, you're ankle looks emancipated for a while after they take off the cast but you recover. This is the fourth time I have seriously sprained the same ankle. When you seriously sprain your ankle you end up with torn ligaments , scar tissue and a weak ankle. Hence why you have to go to a physiotherapist to prevent your ankle from spraining again. Maybe I should phone up my old physiotherapist and demand my money back.</p>
<p>So I am disappointed that I don't get a cool cast, I have to go to physiotherapy again and that the hospital doesn't have crutches. They only had walkers. When I saw the walker I was pretty upset. None of my older family has to use a walker and I do, at 26.</p>
<p>So I must say that this is the most painful sprain I have had yet. I also have a dog now that likes to ram his cute little nose into the baseball (what we are caling my ankle right now). I also get a few more days off of work. I thought about going into work tomorrow and then I started wondering how I would lower myself into the chairs at the kindergarten and thought better of it. Although the kids love slap stick humor, and they would get a kick out of me missing the tiny chair and crashing onto the ground I'm not willing to be that funny. </p>
<p>huzzah! to dramatic days! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ps physiotherapy is not a massage hour. It is painful and you have homework. gross.</p>

    <p>Oh my poor dear! I've had a bad sprained ankle before as well. It sucks, it's painful. I hope you feel better soon! Perhaps you'll get something in the mail for your feet when they are all healed. Send me your address.</p>
