        <p>So crazy things happen to your body when you're pregnant. I'll spare  you most of the insanity, except I sneezed the other day. I sneezed a  HUGE sneeze and pulled a muscle in my side. It hurt so bad, I had  trouble  walking to the taxi to get home. I had trouble walking....because I  sneezed.</p>
<p>So I made it home. But wondered if I should get  myself checked out. I was really in pain. I waited and waited and  thought I would be okay but then around 9 pm, I tried to pick up my bag  from the floor. Silly Debbi. I nearly started crying; it hurt so bad. So  I decided it would probably be best to go and sit in A &amp; E  (Accident and Emergency, not the tv channel) and see a doctor just to  make sure it was a pulled muscle and not something more serious.</p>
<p>Let  me diverge from this story to point out that I seem to carry this baby  big...meaning that everyone expects me to give birth at any moment. (I  am currently only 32 weeks) Everywhere I go, I get stares. Hong Kongers  (not realizing I can understand them) comment to themselves or their  friends: &quot;Hoa dia!&quot; (Very big). I'm not actually that big. My fundal  height is right where it is supposed to be and I haven't gained much  weight in my face, just the necessary areas. Otis's position just seems  to make things look larger. I tell you this because when Dave called the  taxi, the driver's eyes got really big when she saw me get in. Here is  an HUGE! pregnant woman in pain!! asking to go to the hospital! All the  way to the hospital I could feel her eyes on me, pleading with me, to  not give birth in her car.</p>
<p>Anyway, we make it to the hospital  and I give them my HK ID card in A&amp;E and I get back some papers. The  receptionist says &quot;Go to 7F.&quot; Right then, 7F. I'm thinking it is a room  or a bed in emergency. Sweet, I get to bypass triage! But there is no  room or bed in emergency called 7F. So Dave and I are wandering around  the hospital. Eventually we ask someone to point us in the right  direction.</p>
<p>We end up in Obstetrics.</p>
<p>An assistant,  who doesn't speak any English comes over and I say, &quot;Baby ok, ow ow.&quot;  and point to my side. The assistant makes Dave stand outside and takes  me into a room. She takes my blood pressure and my temperature. Then  leaves. Eventually a nurse comes in. It turns out that I had managed to  get admitted to the hospital somewhere between handing them my HK&nbsp;ID&nbsp;card and finding 7F.  And they want me to spend then night.</p>
<p>At this point, I am beginning to doubt  my reason for coming to the hospital (I'm sure Dave is also doubting).  And when it comes down to it, Dave and I are just simply confused. Why  are we in Obstetrics? It is probably a pulled muscle that needs some  panadol (tylenol) and some rest. Turns out that in Hong Kong, if you are  pregnant and show up at the hospital you get directly sent to  Obstetrics. They don't trust emergency doctors with their patients. If  you have a pulled muscle...Obstetrics. Broke your leg?...Obstetrics.  Heart attack?....Obstetrics. Having a baby?....Obstetrics.</p>
<p>And  they want me to spend the night because there is only one Obstetrician  for the ENTIRE hospital and they don't know when she will get to me.</p>
<p>Dave was getting a little hot under the collar. Let me say that  again.  Dave, the calm, rational, unemotional person in this partnership was  getting upset.</p>
<p>I, on the other hand, was as cool as a cucumber. Well, as  relaxed as I could be while clutching my half water/ice bag to my  sneezed out muscle at 10pm at night after mistakenly being admitted to a  hospital. I eventually worked out a deal with the nurses that I would  be admitted for 2 hours. I said I'd stay for 2 hours because that was  the estimated waiting time in emergency. If the doctor managed to see me  in that time...great. If she didn't, then I would just go home.</p>
<p>So  they dobblered me and the baby's heart rate was great. They asked me to  change into these awful pepto-bismal pink hospital clothes. I declined.  Then they decided to do a full fetal wellness check up. I&nbsp;got hooked up to a fetal monitor for 20 minutes and  had to press a button every time Otis moved.</p>
<p>It wasn't  visiting hours, so Dave had to sit outside the ward by himself.</p>
<p>I  had some embroidery that I worked on. I&nbsp;listened   to the other women watch Cantonese melodramas on the teeny tiny  televisions they had in the ward.</p>
<p>Eventually the doctor came  by. She did an ultrasound on my kidneys. Then she asked if she could  check up on Otis. I said she could. Turns out he is very active and he  has very long legs. I joked that he didn't get that from either me or  Dave. She though that he might be a big baby but when she inputted all  her data, he was &quot;within the normal range&quot;. No 10 pounders for me.  Huzzah!</p>
<p>I needed to wait just a little bit longer and then I  was discharged. We were home by 1:30am...with panadol.</p>
<p>And to  be honest, although it was baffling and confusing, I'm glad we went.&nbsp;I know more what to expect when Otis does come.  What to bring, where to go. I&nbsp;felt very  respected by the nurses and doctor. Everyone explained what was going  on. Nobody manhandled me. It was a positive, learning experience.</p>
<p>The nurse said she's looking forward to seeing me in 7-8 weeks.</p>
